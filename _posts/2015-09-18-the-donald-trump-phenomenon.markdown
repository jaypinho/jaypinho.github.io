Two days ago *Al Jazeera America* published [a piece of mine](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/9/trumps-campaign-is-a-farcical-made-for-tv-event.html) about Donald Trump's rise and what it means for American politics:

> Trump knows that his disinterest in policy makes him more relatable, not less. “I play to people’s fantasies,” Trump wrote in his 1987 best-seller, “The Art of the Deal.” “People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole.” And his unrehearsed style reflects his recognition that “truthful hyperbole” never hurts and pseudo-events have replaced policy as a deciding factor in people’s voting preferences.
>
> Trump’s ability to galvanize popular support has earned him favorable comparisons to Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is pursuing the Democratic presidential nomination. However, no equivalence exists between Sanders, a longtime U.S. senator and progressive activist, and Trump, a brash political amateur with a poor grasp of policy. Douglas Rushkoff, a media theorist and scholar who wrote an afterword to Boorstin’s book, suspects Trump initially designed his presidential campaign as a publicity stunt to promote his real estate brand.
>
> “It’s possible he meant the campaign that way,” Rushkoff told me in a recent email interview, “but it succeeded beyond his wildest imagination and now became a self-fulfilling prophecy.”

On my old blog, [The First Casualty](http://archives.jaypinho.com), I had a recurring feature called '[2 A.M. Tune](http://archives.jaypinho.com/tag/2-a.m.-tune/).'

The dirty little secret to that feature, of course, is that I auto-scheduled most of them well before 2 A.M., so they'd go live on the blog only after I'd already fallen asleep.

Now, because my redesigned site no longer uses Wordpress as the CMS and, therefore, I don't (yet) have a built-in post scheduler, I will continue to post occasional songs but they are likely to arrive sporadically at various times throughout the day or night.

Here's the first. It's called 'Show Me The Way', by Penguin Prison.

Two unconnected thoughts:

1) I may have been [slightly tough]({% post_url 2015-05-28-the-problem-with-opposition-research %}) on <em>BuzzFeed</em>.

If there's one thing I wish I had worded slightly differently, it's the last line:

> And given BuzzFeed’s proclivity for running afoul of conventional journalistic ethics, it’s not too far-fetched to assume they’d eventually monetize their research by selling ‘gems’ directly to the opposition candidates themselves.

To be clear, I don't think my intent was entirely wrong: it <em>isn't</em> too far-fetched to <em>wonder</em> if this might happen. But assuming and wondering are two different things, and I would like to retroactively change the wording slightly. (Obviously, I'll leave the original text intact, but let this note serve as my wish to revise it slightly.)

I would also like to engage in some throat-clearing, however. Today the Pew Research Center [released the results of a study](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/millennials-political-news/) on media habits across generational groups: millennials, Generation X-ers, and baby boomers. The results are particularly sobering for <em>BuzzFeed</em>:

Among millennials, who -- according to the study -- are more familiar with <em>BuzzFeed</em>'s oeuvre than Generation X-ers or baby boomers, an abysmal 4% say they trust the site. Of course, some of this can be attributed to lack of awareness: [only 40% of millennials have even heard of <em>BuzzFeed</em>](http://www.journalism.org/interactives/generational-media-habits/table/heard/), a percentage less than half that of <em>The New York Times</em>, for example.

But not all of it. To take that same example, 82% of millennials have heard of <em>The New York Times</em>, and exactly half -- 41% -- trust it. For <em>BuzzFeed</em>, that ratio is not 50%, but 10%. A similar story can be formed from the question of whom millennials <em>distrust</em>: 11% distrust the <em>Times</em> (roughly 13% of those who've heard of it), but 14% distrust <em>BuzzFeed</em>: 35% of all millennials who've heard of the site.

There is a reason for this. It starts with <em>BuzzFeed</em>'s beginnings as a purveyor of cat listicles and extends through a range of questionable activities including [removing posts critical of brand advertisers](http://www.adweek.com/news/press/after-removing-article-critical-dove-buzzfeed-says-it-wants-avoid-publishing-hot-takes-164001) (although the site's editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, maintains that the advertising relationship was not the cause), [quietly deleting over 4,000 posts over time](http://gawker.com/over-4-000-buzzfeed-posts-have-completely-disappeared-1619473070), and even [modifying the site's 'robots.txt' file](https://medium.com/@mathewi/buzzfeed-isn-t-doing-itself-any-favors-on-the-credibility-front-d5e381520b40) to hide specific posts in Google search results.

These are not the actions of a trustworthy news organization. As such, millennials continue to distrust it.

2) On a totally unrelated note, this morning [Adam Liptak](https://twitter.com/adamliptak) of the aforementioned <em>New York Times</em> posted [a piece that detailed the increasingly public lives of the Supreme Court justices](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/politics/justices-get-out-more-but-calendars-arent-open-to-just-anyone.html). The article contains a couple brief quotes by me, as well as (far more interesting and numerous) ones by [Victoria Kwan](https://twitter.com/victoriakwan_), describing the work of [SCOTUS Map](http://scotusmap.com/).

Additionally, Liptak covers [a new study](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2611729) by election law expert [Rick Hasen](https://twitter.com/rickhasen), including a very entertaining introduction of the 'Celebrity Index' of justices on the Supreme Court. The whole thing is highly worth a read, in my (obviously biased) opinion.
